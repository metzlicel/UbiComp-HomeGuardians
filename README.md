# UbiComp-HomeGuardians

Repository for our UbiComp Final Projec: Home Guardians.

Home Guardians helps your baby explore the house through the iPad’s camera and teaches them how to be safe in dangerous zones in a positive way through augmented reality characters. These characters will appear near these Danger Zones to alert the toddlers and reward them when they keeps their distance.
Home Guardians does not punish, scare or scream to the baby, this app reinforces correct decision making, promotes autonomy and builds a positive repetitive learning!
